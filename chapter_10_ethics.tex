\section{Ethics}
\subsection{Ethics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ethics can be defined as a set of shared beliefs which define acceptable and non-acceptable behaviour. In the investment profession, this covers how we treat clients and employers.
\item The role of a code of ethics is to communicate to the public that a profession’s members will use their skill to serve clients in an honest and thical manner
\item A profession is an occupational group that require specialised knowledge, with a focus on ethical behaviour and service to community / society
\item A profession may set or enforce standards for professional behaviour, continuing education, and / or putting clients first
\item The need for high ethical standards is driven by a lack of trust in investment professionals, which increases the cost of capital. Providing false information can lead to slower growth of wider economy
\item Suitability standard
\begin{itemize}
\item Match investments to the risk / return preferences of the client
\end{itemize}
\item Fiduciary standard
\begin{itemize}
\item Act in the best interests of clients -- investment professionals are placed in a position of trust
\end{itemize}
\item Challenges to ethical behaviour
\begin{itemize}
\item Individuals overestimate their ethics
\item External influences include social pressure, loyalty to employer / supervisor / coworker, and money / power / prestige. Client interests should always be put first
\end{itemize}
\item Ethical standards and legal standards overlap, but are not always aligned
\begin{itemize}
\item Some actions may be illegal but ethical, and some actions may be legal but unethical
\item[] Ethical principles set a \underline{higher standard} than laws.
\begin{equation*}
\text{Legality}\cancel\Longleftrightarrow\text{Ethical}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\item The framework for ethical decision makung involves
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify facts, ethical principles, and stakeholders / conflicts
\item Consider alternatives and situational influences (seek guidance)
\item Make a decision and act
\item Evaluate the outcome
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make performance measurements directly comparable, using a standardised approach and methodology
\item Avoid misrepresentation of investment performance

\item Serve current / prospective clients [SMAs] of investment management firms
\end{itemize}
\item Fundamental of compliance extends to a ``distinct business entity’’ complying with \underline{all} standards in order to claim compliance
\item Input data and calculation methodology must be consistent and uniform across firms for fair, comparable presentations. This includes annual data, and showing of a performance benchmark. If $>6$ portfolios, show the standard deviation and 3yr performance of the group
\item Composite and pooled fund maintenance
\begin{itemize}
\item Create meaningful asset-weighted composites
\item Include pooled funds in a composite where relevant
\begin{itemize}
\item A composite is a is a group of portfolios with similar investment mandate and syle

\centering
\begin{tblr}{colspec = {Q[m,2,l] cc Q[m,2,l]}, width = 0.85\textwidth}
Composite time-weighted return &&& \SetCell[r=2]{l}Time-weighted adjusts for external cash flows \\
Composite money-weighted return \\ \\
Pooled fund time-weighted return &&& \SetCell[r=2]{l} If manager controls each flow, use money-weighted return \\
Pooled fund money-weighted return
\end{tblr}
\end{table}
\item[] All contain procedures for reporting fund performance (composites + pooled funds) as well as necessary disclosures
\item GIPS advertising guidlines stiuplate requirements for any advertising that refers to a claim of GIPS compliance

\begin{itemize}
\item Must include all fee-apying discretionary portfolios (current + past) that the firm has maanged in this strategy
\item Groupings must be pre-identified
\item Client restrictions on an accounts mean it is non-discretionary as the fund manager does not have full discretion over investment decisions
